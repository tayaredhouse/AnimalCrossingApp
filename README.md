# Animal Crossing Villager App

This is one of my first React projects that pulls Animal Crossing data from an API and displays them in cards by mapping through the data and destructuring it.

It also has a fully functional search bar where you can search by name for your favorite villager and see information like their birthday and personality in case you're trying to get them a good gift for their birthday! üòâüéÅ

Other things that I implemented was creating a store with Redux to keep track of the data, loading state, and error state to make a better user experience.
